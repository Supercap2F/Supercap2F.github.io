What's up? Welcome to my site!

My name is Daniel and my alias is Supercap2F. I'm 16 (as of 2016) and I've been into doing electronic projects since about 2012. I try and document my main projects here. I'm also into programming and photography, so just about anything might pop up on this blog. :)

Thanks for visiting!
